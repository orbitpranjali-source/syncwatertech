    },
    {
      question: 'How do you ensure water quality in your treatment systems?',
      answer: 'Our systems incorporate multiple quality control measures including multi-stage filtration, real-time monitoring of critical parameters (pH, turbidity, chlorine, TDS), automated chemical dosing, continuous data logging, and alarm systems for any deviations from specified parameters.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is your approach to energy efficiency?',
      answer: 'Energy efficiency is integral to our designs. We use variable frequency drives, optimized pump scheduling, intelligent control algorithms, energy recovery systems, and renewable energy integration where applicable. Our Clarus Fusion technology achieves 30% lower power consumption compared to conventional systems.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you provide training for operating your systems?',
      answer: 'Yes, comprehensive training is included with every installation.
